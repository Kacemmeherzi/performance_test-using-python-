# performance_test-using-python-

This project evaluates the performance of various sorting algorithms by measuring their execution time on different input sizes and data distributions. It is designed to help understand the efficiency and behavior of sorting algorithms in different scenarios.

## Features

- Implementation of common sorting algorithms:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Selection Sort
- Performance analysis using:
  - Random datasets
  - Sorted datasets
  - Reverse-sorted datasets
- Comparison of execution times for different algorithms.
- Flexible input size and dataset generation.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed (v3.6 or later). You can download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
